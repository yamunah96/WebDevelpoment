        Elephants are gentle giants that live in deep green forests.<br />
        They walk slowly through trees and grass, making soft footsteps.<br />
        Elephants use their long trunks to pick leaves and drink cool water.<br />
        In the forest, they enjoy splashing in rivers and mud to stay cool.<br />
        Baby elephants love to play and follow their mothers everywhere.<br />
        The forest gives elephants food, water, and a safe home.<br />
        Elephants help the forest grow by spreading seeds as they walk.<br />
        They have strong family bonds and never leave each other behind.<br />
        Birds, monkeys, and many animals share the forest with them.<br />
        We must protect forests so elephants can live happy, safe lives.<br />
